### 4. **Typespecs and Documentation** (`feature/typespecs`)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Add type specifications and improve documentation
- **Benefits**:
  - Better code maintainability
  - Improved IDE autocompletion
  - Self-documenting code
- **Tasks**:
  - Add @spec for all public functions
  - Create module documentation with @moduledoc
  - Document API endpoints with @doc
  - Add type definitions for common data structures

## Future Features

    - Automate periodic tasks
    - Maintain system health through scheduled cleanup
    - Support for time-based job triggers
  - **Tasks**:
    - Implement cron-like scheduling system
    - Add recurring job definitions to API
    - Create scheduler process for managing recurring jobs
    - Handle timezone and daylight saving time
    - Implement pause/resume functionality for recurring jobs

### Data Persistence
- `feature/sqlite-persistence` - SQLite database for persistent job storage
  - **Description**: Replace in-memory storage with SQLite for job persistence
  - **Benefits**:
    - Jobs survive server restarts
    - Data integrity with transactions
    - No data loss on shutdown
    - Easier debugging and inspection
  - **Tasks**:

### Security
- `feature/request-validation` - Comprehensive request validation
- `feature/security-headers` - Security headers (CSP, XSS protection)
- `feature/cors-support` - Cross-origin resource sharing
- `feature/rate-limiting` - Rate limiting for API endpoints

### Performance and Monitoring
- `feature/response-compression` - Gzip compression
- `feature/caching` - Response caching
- `feature/telemetry-integration` - Telemetry for monitoring
- `feature/error-reporting` - Error reporting integration

### API Improvements
- `feature/ecto-validation` - Ecto schema validation
- `feature/api-documentation` - API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- `feature/recurring-tasks` - Support for recurring/scheduled tasks
- `feature/sqlite-persistence` - SQLite database for persistent job storage

### Code Quality
- `feature/test-suite` - Comprehensive test suite
- `feature/code-coverage` - Code coverage reporting

### Documentation
- `feature/readme-updates` - Update README with setup and usage
- `feature/api-docs` - Generated API documentation

## Branch Strategy
- `develop` - Main development branch
- `release/v0.2.0` - Release branch
- `hotfix/*` - Hotfix branches
- `feature/*` - Feature branches (create from develop, merge back to develop)

## Recommendations
1. Start with the 4 high-priority features in order
2. Each feature branch should be self-contained
3. Write tests for new features
4. Ensure documentation is updated
5. Follow semantic versioning for releases
